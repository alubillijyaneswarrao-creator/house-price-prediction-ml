🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning regression techniques.
The model learns the relationship between various house features and their corresponding prices to make accurate predictions on unseen data.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline, including data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

🎯 Problem Statement
To build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on given features such as area, number of rooms, and other relevant parameters.
Since house price is a continuous numerical value, this problem is treated as a Regression task.

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
🔹 Algorithm Used
Linear Regression
🔹 Why Linear Regression?
Suitable for predicting continuous values
Learns the best-fitting line between input features and output price
Simple, interpretable, and effective as a baseline model

🛠️ ML Pipeline Followed

Data Loading
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Feature Selection
Train–Test Split
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Price Prediction

📊 Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RMSE indicates the average difference between predicted house prices and actual prices in the same units as the target variable.
