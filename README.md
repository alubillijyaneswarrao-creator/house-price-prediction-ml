📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques.
 The goal is to build an end-to-end ML pipeline starting from data exploration to model evaluation, following industry-standard practices.
The project was developed iteratively to emphasize understanding, correctness, and improvement, rather than just training a single model.

🎯 Problem Statement
Predict the selling price of houses based on various features such as location, size, and other property characteristics.
This is a regression problem, where the target variable is continuous.

🧠 Approach & Workflow
The project follows a complete machine learning workflow:
**1.Data Understanding & Exploration**
Dataset inspection
Shape, data types, and summary statistics
Identification of missing values

**2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Distribution analysis of numerical features
Correlation analysis using heatmaps
Initial insights into feature–target relationships

**3.Data Preprocessing**
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding
Train–test split
Feature scaling using StandardScaler


**4.Model Building**
Baseline Linear Regression model
Improved Linear Regression with feature scaling
Ridge Regression (regularization)
**5.Model Evaluation**
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score
Comparison of multiple models to select the best approach

🛠️ Models Implemented**
**Model**                        **Description**

Linear Regression                Baseline regression model

Linear Regression (Scaled)       Regression after feature scaling

Ridge Regression                 Regularized regression to reduce overfitting


📊 Evaluation Metrics
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures prediction error magnitude

R² Score: Measures how well the model explains variance in target value

A comparison table is created to clearly evaluate model performance.
